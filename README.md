# My personal website

This is the first personal website I've ever made so I made it pretty simple. I'll make something more complex in the future.

## Hosting

It's hosted with Vercel and you can see it live at [nashpillai.com](https://nashpillai.com/).

## Tech Stack

I started with the t3 template which uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I also used [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for fancy animations.

## Registrar

I recommend using [Ionos](https://www.ionos.com/) to get a ".com" domain for just $1 for the first year. Then, after 60 days you can transfer it to Cloudflare and pay $10.44/year.

## Email

I currently use Cloudflare email forwarding to forward emails to my personal email. I will be setting up a self hosted email server soon.

## License

This project is open source and available under the GPL-3.0 License so you can use it as long as derivative works are also open source (credit is appreciated).
